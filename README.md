# Jekyll Gdrive Plugin

Access data from a Google Drive Spreadsheet in your Jekyll sites

## Installation

Add these lines to your Gemfile:

```ruby
group :jekyll_plugins do
  gem 'jekyll-gdrive'
end
```

And then execute:

    $ bundle install

## Usage

Before you can access any data from GDrive you need to configure your GDrive API credentials. After installing the plugin, run:

    $ bundle exec jekyll gdrive

And follow the instructions to create an application in Google's developer console and generate a refresh token.

Once you have the token, you need to set it up as an environment variable before running `jekyll build`. The GDrive plugin will give you an export statement you can use to setup your environment:

    $ export GDRIVE=<client_id>:<client_secret>:<your gdrive token>

You'll also need to configure the plugin to use the right spreadsheet.

Add this to your `_config.yml`:

```yaml
gdrive:
  sheet: "title of my spreadsheet"
```

## Choosing which tab in the Sheet to use
You can add a choice in your configuration for which tab in the Sheet will be used. Bear in mind that these tab numbers are zero-indexed (i.e. `0` corresponds to the first tab in the sheet.) If none is specified, the first tab will be used.

```yaml
gdrive:
  sheet: "title of my spreadsheet"
  tab: 2
```

## Accessing your Google Sheet data

In any Liquid template you can now use: `site.data.google_sheet` to access your sheet data.

Example:

```html
<table>
    <thead>
      {% for row in site.data.google_sheet limit:1 %}
        <tr>
          {% for col in row %}<th>{{col}}</th>{% endfor %}
        </tr>
      {% endfor %}
    </thead>
    <tbody>
      {% for row in site.data.google_sheet offset:1 %}
        <tr>
          {% for col in row %}<td>{{col}}</td>{% endfor %}
        </tr>
      {% endfor %}  
    </tbody>
  </table>
```

## Caching

Google's Drive API is not incredibly fast. When working in `jekyll serve --watch` mode you'll quickly get tired of waiting for the spreadsheet data to load on every refresh.

To work around this you can specify a cache period for the gdrive plugin in the Jekyll configuration:

```yaml
gdrive:
   sheet: "My sheet"
   cache_period: 5 minutes
```

This will store the sheet in a local `_gdrive_cache` file and only reload the sheet data once every 5 minutes.

You can specify the time in `seconds`, `minutes` or `hours`.
